## Normal users process
1. To run this code you will need a version of Ruby  more recent than 3.
2. To run the game you need to execute main.rb, like: ruby app/main.rb.
3. When the game is running, you need to press enter to make a aleatory shoot


## Developer process
- If you want to test the methods of the program then you will need to install some gems that you cand find in the file 'Gemfile' just run the command 'bundle install' and the gem will automatically be installed

### TDD
- spec/bowling_game_spec.rb make three tests, the first one is to verify how works the "spare?" method,  
  the second one is to verify how works the "strike?" method,  
  the last one is used to check if the score of every frame is correct
